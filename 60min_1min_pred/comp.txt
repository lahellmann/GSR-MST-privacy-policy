Both models are performing similarly, with Keras being marginally better in terms of both variance and maximum error. 
Given the small differences in performance, you can confidently say that both implementations are achieving comparable results, 
with either being a viable choice for this task. You might see slightly better results with Keras in this case, 
but the differences are minor.
